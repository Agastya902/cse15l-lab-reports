# **Lab Report 2 - Server and Bugs (Week 3)**

## **Part 1:** ``String Server``

This part of the lab report required me to create a new server called ``StringServer``. When the path of the URL is changed, a string is displayed on the web page. If we further change the path of the URL, a new string is displayed in the next line along with the previous string. The image attached below shows my code for the ```StringServer``` class. These classes are similar to the files that we worked with in Lab while creating ```NumberServer```.

```
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.URI;

class StringHandler implements URLHandler 
{

    int num = 0;
    String newString = "";

    public String handleRequest(URI url) 
    {
        if (url.getPath().equals("/")) 
        {
            return "";
        }
        else 
        {
            System.out.println("Path: " + url.getPath());
            if (url.getPath().contains("/add-message")) 
            {
                String[] parameters = url.getQuery().split("=");
                if (parameters[0].equals("s")) 
                {
                    newString += parameters[1] +"\n";
                     
                }
                return newString;
            }
            return "404 Not Found!";
        }
    }
}

class StringServer 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException 
    {
        if(args.length == 0){
            System.out.println("Missing port number! Try any number between 1024 to 49151");
            return;
        }

        int port = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);

        Server.start(port, new StringHandler());
    }
}
```


### **Implementation of /add-message**

1. **/add-message?s=hi**
   When the above path is typed after localhost:4003, the ``StringHandler`` method is called which further calls the handle method. The handle method is called with the URI as the argument. In the ``StringHandler`` class, the program checks if the path has ``/add-message`` in it. When ``/add-message`` is found, the program creates an array which holds the contents of the String after the "=" sign.

2. **/add-message?s=ronnie**
   When the above path is typed in after the previous attempt, the handle method in ``StringHandler`` with the URI is called again. Now the program checks if the ``/add-message`` exists in the path. Then it creates an array which stores the string after the "=" sign. Here it is "ronnie". Now the given string ("ronnie") is printed in a new line because we used "/n" in the previous iteration.

## **Part 2:**
I chose the bug in the ```reverseInPlace``` method of the ```ArrayExamples``` class.

**Input that induces failure**
```@Test
  public void testReverseInPlace1() 
  {
    int[] input1 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0}, input1);
  }
  ```
  **Input that does not induce a failure**
  ```@Test 
	public void testReverseInPlace() 
  {
    int[] input1 = { 3 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3 }, input1);
	}
```

## **Part 3:**

Lab in Week 2 introduced us to the inner workings of a web page. I think that this was really helpful because we use we pages for even simple things now days. After running the server on a remote computer in the CSE basement, I got a URL that could be accessed from any device. The most exciting part was that when editing the server, the change was displayed immediately on the web page that i created.
Lab in Week 3 was about Server and bugs. We were taught the basics of testing a code using jUnit testing. We were also given a thoughtful insigt on how we can use symptoms and testing to find bugs and fix the code. I think that this will also help me in CSE12 which I am taking this quarter.
